New Hospital project 
<br>
Hospital Management System will build patient, diagnostic, instruments, pharmacy and billing management application that will provide integrated capabilities for patient management, pharmacy management, history management, Inventory Control and Billing. The application will be designed to support every step of a patient’s treatment flow, starting with the registration of the patient to the discharge summary of the patient. 

Multiple manual entries of the patient records continually increase the complexity and volume of records. Staff members find it very tedious to search patient’s record, instruments in proper condition, remaining stock of drug and diagnostic history for reports to be submitted to the hospital or government bodies within short period of time. By creating a common application to manage patients’ record and billing, application will:

	Expedite process of registration by reducing waiting time of outpatient 
	Reduce duplication of record by eliminating multiple manual data entry
	Enable quick search of patients progress record 
	Enable proper maintenance of drug/medicine stock 
	Enable proper management of instruments record
	Enable to generate reports within short time period. 

This project offers comprehensive solution to automate the major processes of the hospital with primary focus on management of patients’ record from registration to discharge and billing process so as to optimize the time of doctors and staff members

The following are the business requirements for this project:

	On line registration of patient within a hospital so as to reduce the waiting time of the patient.

	Generate unique registration ID which will be common across the application modules to enter further records related to the patient

	Scheduling of the operations

	Quick search of the bed occupancy

	Quick Search of patients’ progress within a hospital

	Proper maintenance of instruments record

	Proper management of drugs and medicines

	Billing process at the discharge of the patient

	Related reports generation within short time period

Implement all of the above processes as common across all operating Hospitals
